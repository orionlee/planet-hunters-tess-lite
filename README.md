# Planet Hunters TESS Lite

Available at: https://orionlee.github.io/planet-hunters-tess-lite/pht_lite.html

Present random TICs from a TESS Sector so that one can inspect lightcurves, and
discuss with others in [Planet Hunters TESS Community](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nora-dot-eisner/planet-hunters-tess/talk).

## Hacks

The webapp randomly picks TICs with SPOC 2-minute cadence lightcurves available from the default sector, currently sector 79.

One can override the sector used by appending a hash to the URL, e.g., appending `#source=tesscurl_sector_82_lc.sh` will switch to sector 82. The list of available sectors can be found at [MAST Bulk Downloads](https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/bulk_downloads/bulk_downloads_ffi-tp-lc-dv.html#:~:text=Lightcurve) page.
